### Domain of Interest - Crime

**Why are you interested in this field/domain?**

As world citizens, crime is a domain of information that we all care about and relate to. Knowing about the world situation is **advantageous** as we can be aware of certain **dangers** to avoid so we can live a _peaceful_ and _happy_ life.

Therefore, we are interested to know about crimes that are happening all over the world with various motives. Additionally, we would like to know how crime _types_ are distributed in different **locations**. It is important that we know about the kinds of crimes happening around the world so that we can think of potential **problems** that need the most attention and perhaps their **solutions**.

### 3. Hate Crime Data - Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)
  - Many countries have reported official hate crime data to the _ODIHR_. Fortunately, these countries have also passed legislation to address the **under-reporting** of hate crimes, to investigate, prevent, and prosecute hate crimes, and provide penalties for them. They have also committed to collecting and maintaining data on hate crimes as well as make them _public_. The ODIHR website contains hate crimes that have been reported to them by these nations.
